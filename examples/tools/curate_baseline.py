# REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION. Taken verbatim from the project it was written for, and
# tied to that project's report schema. It is here to be read, not to be dropped into
# another tree: what transfers is the list of things it refuses to do. See
# examples/tools/README.md and MEASUREMENT.md of the standard.
#
# Turns one raw benchmark report into a curated baseline, and keeps the raw report
# next to it so the result can be checked.
#
# Until this existed, curation was a human retyping numbers into a different schema:
# the harness writes per-run entries with keys like "ee", the curated file carries
# averages under "ee_pct", and nothing recorded which run produced what. The first
# canonical baseline turned out to blend two sessions - its frametime and spread came
# from one run of the scene, its subsystem counters from another whose spread was
# twice as large. The file the docs call the source of truth was reporting a spread
# that did not belong to half its contents.
#
# A baseline is therefore the curation of exactly ONE session. If you want another
# session's numbers, curate it as its own file; both raw reports are committed.
#
#   python tools/curate_baseline.py tools/bench/results/<report>.json --label baseline
#
# Editorial prose in an existing baseline (scene description, observations, caveats)
# is preserved: this tool owns the numbers, a human owns the explanation.
